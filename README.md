# Coin-Flipping-Simulator
Simple script used to observe the behavior of simulated coin flips.


For larger simulations, it takes a while to run the way I have it structured, so it could be worth your time to enhance runtime if you want to do something more intensive with this project.

I've posted a chart showing two simulations of 1,000,000 flips, so you don't have to run it out that far if you just want to take a peek at what flips 500,000 â€“ 1,000,000 might look like. 

I actually learned a lot more than I thought I might about probability and randomness when I put this project together and started to analyze it. My initial goal with the project was to determine how many flip(s) it might take to maximize the probability of flipping heads, if at all possible. I noticed that probabilities were teeter-tottering around 0.5 for larger simulations, but not converging toward 0.5 as had been expected. The reason for this, was that "randomness" was not perfectly random.
